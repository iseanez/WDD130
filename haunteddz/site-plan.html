      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Every year, the company I work for organizes a Halloween contest, so I decided to create a website that shows the different projects of the teams and departments that participate in this decoration and costume-themed event. My site will show pictures/videos of each individual costume and the participating team's project. The cherry on the cake of my website will be the result of the contest with the winners selected by the qualifying jury.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Visitors to our site will be people who love costumes and everything that currently surrounds this fascinating Halloween tradition. The site will serve not only as entertainment for them but also as a reference regarding some original ideas that they can emulate in case they need an ingenious costume for an event.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <p>
        People will come to my site because they enjoy the excitement that comes from mysterious, creepy, mystical, dark, and incredible costumes, places, and settings looking to get a reference on what costumes are the most popular and how they were achieved, wanting to see spooky photos and perhaps hearing a horror story from the company that will even make them cringe and wish they had lived through these experiences in person. They will come to my site because they like to feel the adrenaline rush of fear that well-executed costumes and decor instill. They like to find novelties in terms of clothing and decoration to be able to replicate them for their personal, family, and work team use.
My visitors expect to find answers to the following questions: Why is it important for this company to celebrate Halloween? Is there a prize for preparing all these costumes and arrangements? Are the costumes professionals or beginners? Did they use original ideas or just traditional ideas? Did they do it individually or as a team? What motivated the participants to dedicate time and resources to be an active part of this celebration? Is there some dark legend in the company that motivates this celebration? Have you had any paranormal experiences in the company when everything is dark? How does the company to which you belong motivate you to participate in this way?
Visitors to my site will want to write in the chat on the page what, in their opinion, are the best costumes and decorations. They will want to give their input on the making of the costumes and the design of the workplaces. They will want to upload photos of their costumes and decorations at home, in their workplaces, and their cities, proving that they too can create costumes and decorations worthy of being appreciated by all. They will be motivated by the idea that their achievements in the locker room are known not only locally but also internationally.
In order for visitors to participate in the different activities within the site, they will be required to register on the site by creating a username and providing their email, so that they can receive more information and that their comments and participation within the site can be identified. by other site visitors.
My visitors will want to come to my site to get the excitement and information they are looking for because the photos are of excellent quality, plus some of the costumes and decorations around the venues are scary, giving them ideas to replicate. costumes, or those decorations at home or work. The page is an invitation so that the Halloween celebration can be used by other companies to foster team spirit and belonging to their different organizations. It will be a real testimony that when employees are motivated, companies benefit from that motivation, as employees will perform better in the activities assigned in their various positions knowing that the company cares about giving them not only the time, but the space they need to express themselves actively participating in projects that have nothing to do with the company's business, but with the pleasure that many people have for participating in this type of celebration. Visitors who are also employees will know that they can look to do the same in their various workplaces, holding DataZone as an example of what a multinational company can achieve when it cares about the well-being of its employees. That is the tremendous impact that an activity of this type can achieve, although some consider it an inconsequential and fruitless activity to strengthen a company and grow its profits.
